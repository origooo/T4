exerc_3_4.c: (in function main)
exerc_3_4.c:39:16: Arrow access from possibly null pointer person:
                      person->firstName
  A possibly null pointer is dereferenced.  Value is either the result of a
  function which may return null (in which case, code should check it is not
  null), or a global, parameter or structure field declared with the null
  qualifier. (Use -nullderef to inhibit warning)
   exerc_3_4.c:38:19: Storage person may become null
exerc_3_4.c:43:9: Test expression for while not boolean, type int: loop
  Test expression type is not boolean or int. (Use -predboolint to inhibit
  warning)
exerc_3_4.c:52:3: Return value (type int) ignored: scanf("%i", &option)
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalint to inhibit warning)
exerc_3_4.c: (in function write_new_file)
exerc_3_4.c:87:36: Possibly null storage file passed as non-null param:
                      fwrite (..., file)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
   exerc_3_4.c:86:9: Storage file may become null
exerc_3_4.c:87:2: Return value (type size_t) ignored: fwrite(inrecord,...
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalother to inhibit warning)
exerc_3_4.c:88:2: Return value (type int) ignored: fclose(file)
exerc_3_4.c: (in function append_file)
exerc_3_4.c:97:36: Possibly null storage file passed as non-null param:

exerc_3_4.c:97:2: Return value (type size_t) ignored: fwrite(inrecord,...
exerc_3_4.c:98:2: Return value (type int) ignored: fclose(file)
exerc_3_4.c: (in function input_record)
exerc_3_4.c:106:9: Operands of != have incompatible types (int, char):
                      getchar() != '\n'
  A character constant is used as an int. Use +charintliteral to allow
  character constants to be used as ints.  (This is safe since the actual type
  of a char constant is int.)
exerc_3_4.c:108:2: Return value (type char *) ignored: fgets(fname, 20,...
exerc_3_4.c:112:2: Return value (type char *) ignored: fgets(lname, 20,...
exerc_3_4.c:116:2: Return value (type char *) ignored: fgets(pn, 13, stdin)

exerc_3_4.c:165:15: Possibly null storage temp passed as non-null param:
                       fread (temp, ...)
   exerc_3_4.c:157:17: Storage temp may become null
exerc_3_4.c:165:40: Possibly null storage file passed as non-null param:

   exerc_3_4.c:162:9: Storage file may become null
exerc_3_4.c:165:9: Test expression for while not boolean, type size_t:
                      fread(temp, sizeof(PERSON), 1, file)
exerc_3_4.c:166:8: Operand of ! is non-boolean (int):
                      !strcmp(nameString, temp->firstName)
  The operand of a boolean operator is not a boolean. Use +ptrnegate to allow !
  to be used on pointers. (Use -boolops to inhibit warning)
exerc_3_4.c:175:5: Return value (type int) ignored: fclose(file)
exerc_3_4.c: (in function search_by_lastname)
exerc_3_4.c:191:15: Possibly null storage temp passed as non-null param:
